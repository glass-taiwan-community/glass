# Maintainers

This project is maintained by the community under the
`glass-taiwan-community` organization.

Maintenance is based on shared responsibility, transparency, and
best-effort availability rather than strict service-level guarantees.

discussions, and releases for this repository:

## Maintenance Philosophy

This repository follows a **community-first** maintenance model:

- No single maintainer owns the project
- Decisions are made in public, primarily via GitHub issues and pull requests
- Contributions are welcomed from all regions and backgrounds
- Maintenance activity is best-effort and volunteer-driven

This project does not aim to replace the upstream project and remains
open to upstream collaboration when possible.

---

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Maintainers may help with the following activities, depending on
availability:

- Reviewing and providing feedback on pull requests
- Triaging issues and facilitating discussion
- Coordinating releases when changes are ready
- Proposing relevant improvements upstream when appropriate

Maintainers are **not required** to provide guaranteed response times
or fixed release schedules.

---

## Adding or Removing Maintainers

New maintainers may be proposed by existing maintainers or active
contributors.

The general criteria include:

- A history of constructive contributions
- Respectful and collaborative communication
- Willingness to help coordinate community efforts

Changes to the maintainer list should be discussed openly and recorded
in this file.

---

## Decision Making

This project follows a **lazy consensus** model:

- Proposals are made via issues or pull requests
- If no significant objections are raised after reasonable discussion,
  changes may proceed
- In case of disagreement, maintainers should seek consensus and
  document decisions publicly

---

## Code of Conduct

All maintainers and contributors are expected to follow the project's
Code of Conduct.

Maintainers are responsible for helping uphold a respectful and
inclusive environment.
